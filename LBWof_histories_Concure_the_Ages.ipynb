        "### `MythicBossHead` Script Documentation\n",
        "\n",
        "**File:** `MythicBossHead.cs`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "This script is designed to be attached to individual 'head' GameObjects of a multi-headed mythological boss (e.g., a Hydra). It governs the head's health, its reaction to specific player interactions (like being hit by a 'Torch'), and its response to logical signals from the `GadgetManager` to determine if it's successfully defeated or if it regenerates more heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features & Integration:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`ILogicReceiver` Implementation:**\n",
        "    *   The `MythicBossHead` implements the `ILogicReceiver` interface, making it a target for signals from the `GadgetManager`. This allows for complex, multi-stage interactions and puzzles where other game elements (e.g., a lever, a pressure plate, or even a player's crafted item) can send a signal to influence the boss's behavior.\n",
        "    *   **LBP Aesthetic:** This directly integrates with the LittleBigPlanet \"gadget\" philosophy, where game elements are interconnected and respond to defined logical inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Health and State Variables:**\n",
        "    *   `public int health = 2;`: Represents the hit points of an individual head. This integrates with standard RPG combat mechanics.\n",
        "    *   `public bool isSearing = false;`: A crucial state flag. This boolean tracks whether the head has been successfully 'cauterized' by a 'Torch' (or similar burning effect), preventing regeneration. This state is essential for the `OnLogicSignal` method's success condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Physics-Based Interaction (`OnCollisionEnter`):**\n",
        "    *   `void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)`: This Unity physics callback detects when another GameObject physically collides with the boss head.\n",
        "    *   `if (collision.gameObject.tag == \"Torch\")`: Specifically checks if the colliding object has the \"Torch\" tag. This demonstrates how player-controlled items (like the 'Torch Gadget' from the `Lernaean Hydra` quest JSON) interact with the boss.\n",
        "    *   `isSearing = true;`: If a \"Torch\" hits, the `isSearing` flag is set, indicating a successful cauterization attempt. This is a direct consequence of a player action.\n",
        "    *   **Communication Flow:** This method acts as a communication point where physical interactions from other game objects directly modify the boss head's internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Logical Signal Response (`OnLogicSignal`):**\n",
        "    *   `public void OnLogicSignal(float value)`: This method is called by the `GadgetManager` when a logical signal is sent to this specific boss head (identified by its `gadgetID`).\n",
        "    *   **Success Condition:** `if (value >= 1.0f && isSearing)`: For the head to be permanently defeated, two conditions must be met:\n",
        "        1.  A strong logical signal (`value >= 1.0f`) is received (e.g., from a mechanism triggered by a severed head, or a powerful player ability).\n",
        "        2.  The head must currently be `isSearing` (meaning it was recently hit by a 'Torch').\n",
        "    *   `Destroy(gameObject);`: If both conditions are met, the head is successfully defeated and removed from the game.\n",
        "    *   **Regeneration (LBP Aesthetic):** `else { SpawnNewHeads(); }`: If the signal is received but the head is *not* searing (or the signal is insufficient), the Hydra regenerates! This is a core LBP-style twist, where a failure to correctly execute a sequence leads to a whimsical, yet challenging, consequence. The `SpawnNewHeads()` method (to be implemented) would likely use a Unity `Emitter` or `Instantiate` to create new `MythicBossHead` instances, possibly two, to represent the classic Hydra regeneration.\n",
        "    *   **Communication & State Transition:** This method is central to the boss fight's state transitions, directly influencing whether the boss is defeated or becomes more challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Usage in a Quest (e.g., `Lernaean Hydra`):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   A `QuestManager` would be tracking the \"Lernaean Hydra\" quest (`quest_id: HERC_LABOR_02`).\n",
        "*   One objective, \"Sever the Hydra's head,\" might involve the player dealing `required_force: 50.0` damage. Upon severing, the `QuestManager` or the `HydraCombatLogic` (which likely manages the overall boss) would activate logic to then allow the `OnLogicSignal` to be relevant.\n",
        "*   The second objective, \"Apply fire to the neck using the Torch Gadget,\" would involve the player colliding a \"Torch\" item with this `MythicBossHead` to set `isSearing = true`.\n",
        "*   Finally, a subsequent action (e.g., using a specific ability, or triggering another gadget linked to the severed head) would send the `OnLogicSignal` to this `MythicBossHead`. If `isSearing` is true, the head is destroyed; otherwise, new heads appear.\n",
        "\n",
        "This script effectively combines RPG mechanics (health, conditions), LBP interactive gadgetry (`ILogicReceiver`, `GadgetManager` signals, whimsical regeneration), and physics-based interactions to create a unique and engaging mythological boss encounter."

Quests might involve scaling dangerous peaks to consult oracles, retrieving artifacts blessed by gods, or battling legendary beasts.\n",

Quests here could involve charting unknown waters, recovering sunken treasures, or defending coastal settlements from pirate raids.\n",

        "\n",
        "Integrating ancient stories and historical facts will be a cornerstone of the game's narrative design, providing depth, authenticity, and a strong sense of discovery. The process will involve a multi-layered approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Deep Historical & Mythological Research:**\n",
        "    *   **Academic Consultation:** Collaborating with historians, archaeologists, and mythologists specializing in the relevant ancient cultures (e.g., Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Celtic, Mesopotamian, Norse, Polynesian, Han Chinese). This ensures accuracy and provides a wealth of primary and secondary source material.\n",
        "    *   **Primary Source Analysis:** Examining historical texts, epics, religious scriptures, archaeological findings (inscriptions, artifacts, architectural plans), and mythological cycles to extract specific events, figures, beliefs, technologies, and social structures.\n",
        "    *   **Cross-Cultural Synthesis:** Identifying common themes, archetypes, and narrative structures across different cultures that can be woven together to form a cohesive yet diverse world lore. For instance, the concept of heroic journeys, divine interventions, or tragic falls of empires.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Transformation into Engaging In-Game Content:**\n",
        "    *   **Lore Extraction and Adaptation:** Raw historical data or mythical tales will be distilled into core narrative beats, character motivations, and thematic elements. These will then be adapted to fit the game's overarching fantasy setting, often involving creative interpretation and minor embellishment to suit gameplay needs without losing the essence of the original source.\n",
        "    *   **Environmental Storytelling:** Historical facts and myths will be embedded directly into the environment. For example, specific architectural styles, ruined monuments, or distinct flora/fauna can visually tell a story. Inscriptions on ancient tablets (inspired by real-world cuneiform or hieroglyphs) will provide clues or reveal forgotten lore.\n",
        "    *   **Character and Faction Development:** Historical figures, deities, or legendary heroes will inspire key NPCs and factions. Their beliefs, conflicts, and relationships will be drawn from historical or mythological precedents, driving political intrigue, religious quests, or personal vendettas.\n",
        "    *   **Quest-Giver Narratives:** Quest-givers will often be direct descendants of historical figures, guardians of ancient traditions, or scholars obsessed with forgotten lore. Their dialogue will be rich with historical references and fragmented tales, encouraging players to delve deeper.\n",
        "    *   **Artifacts and Collectibles:** Many in-game items will be direct representations or inspired by historical artifacts (e.g., a specific type of Roman gladius, an Egyptian ankh, a Celtic torc). Collecting these could unlock lore entries, initiate quests, or provide unique gameplay benefits linked to their historical significance.\n",
        "    *   **Puzzle and Challenge Design:** Puzzles could be based on ancient astronomical knowledge, deciphering ancient languages, or recreating historical rituals. Combat challenges might involve encountering creatures or enemies inspired by mythological beings (e.g., minotaurs, griffins, jötun).\n",
        "    *   **Branching Questlines & Moral Choices:** Historical events often involved complex moral dilemmas and conflicting loyalties. These can be translated into quests where player choices have tangible consequences, reflecting the ambiguity and multi-faceted nature of historical narratives.\n",
        "    *   **Dynamic Events:** Certain historical cycles, like the rise and fall of empires or natural disasters, can be translated into dynamic in-game events that periodically reshape parts of the world, creating new quest opportunities and environmental changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "By carefully weaving these researched elements into every aspect of the game, players will not only embark on an epic adventure but also gain a deeper appreciation for the rich tapestry of human history and mythology."

        "\n",
        "The game will feature a diverse range of quest archetypes, each designed to engage players in different ways and contribute to the overarching narrative and world-building. These archetypes will ensure a varied gameplay experience, from deep narrative exploration to repeatable activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Main Story Quests (MSQ):** These quests form the core narrative progression of the game, guiding the player through the central conflict, uncovering major lore, and introducing key characters and factions. They are typically linear but will incorporate significant branching choices (see point 5).\n",
        "    *   **Example:** The player is tasked with retrieving a shard of an ancient artifact, said to be a relic of a fallen civilization. This quest takes them through multiple biomes, encountering different factions vying for its power, culminating in a confrontation with a major antagonist.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Side Quests (SQ):** Optional quests that offer deeper dives into the lore, explore the stories of secondary characters, introduce unique challenges, or unlock specific areas and rewards. They often have localized impacts on the world.\n",
        "    *   **Example (Ancient Forests):** An elder druid requests help in cleansing a sacred grove corrupted by an encroaching shadow blight. Completing it might unlock a unique herbal crafting recipe or reveal a hidden passage.\n",
        "    *   **Example (Desert Sands):** A merchant in an oasis city needs assistance recovering stolen goods from desert bandits, leading to a small-scale combat encounter and a reward of valuable trade resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Faction Quests (FQ):** Quests tied to specific in-game factions (e.g., a scholarly guild, a warrior order, a clandestine society). Completing these improves reputation with the faction, unlocks unique gear, abilities, or access to faction-specific areas, and can influence the game's political landscape.\n",
        "    *   **Example (Ruined Cities):** The player is recruited by a fledgling civic restoration committee to investigate the ruins of the ancient senate building for clues about its collapse, potentially uncovering a conspiracy that influences their standing with other factions.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Exploration Quests (EQ):** Quests focused on discovering new locations, mapping unknown territories, or uncovering hidden secrets and vistas. These often reward players with experience, lore entries, or resources.\n",
        "    *   **Example:** A cartographer in a coastal town offers a bounty for mapping undiscovered islands or locating a mythical sea creature's breeding grounds. This involves navigating treacherous waters and using observation skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Collection Quests (CQ):** Quests requiring players to gather a specific number or type of items, often for crafting, research, or to fulfill a specific request. These are generally repeatable but can also be one-off story-driven tasks.\n",
        "    *   **Example (Mythical Mountains):** A reclusive alchemist needs rare volcanic minerals found only in the deepest mountain caves to complete a powerful potion. The quest involves environmental puzzles and battling fire-elemental creatures.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Combat/Bounty Quests (CCQ):** Quests centered around defeating specific enemies, clearing monster nests, or hunting down notorious individuals. These provide opportunities for combat skill progression and often reward unique gear or currency.\n",
        "    *   **Example:** A village guard posts a bounty for a giant monstrous spider that has been preying on livestock in the Ancient Forest, requiring the player to track and defeat the creature in its lair.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Crafting/Resource Quests (CRQ):** Quests that involve acquiring resources and crafting specific items, often serving as tutorials for crafting systems or unlocking advanced schematics.\n",
        "    *   **Example:** A master blacksmith in a dwarven hold tasks the player with forging a legendary weapon, requiring them to gather rare ores and components from across the world and utilize the blacksmith's unique forge.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Daily/Weekly Quests:** Repeatable, often procedural quests designed to provide ongoing activities, progression, and resource generation post-main story or as supplementary content. These will often be variations of collection, combat, or delivery quests.\n",
        "    *   **Example:** A local farmer needs help defending their crops from a daily infestation of pests, or a trader requires a swift delivery of goods to a neighboring settlement under a time limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each archetype will contribute to the player's sense of agency and progression, allowing them to choose how they engage with the world and its many stories."

        "### 5. Quest Narrative Structure and Branching Logic\n",
        "\n",
        "Quest narratives will be designed to offer players meaningful choices and consequences, ensuring that their decisions have a tangible impact on the world, characters, and future quest availability. This will be achieved through a robust branching logic system integrated into dialogue, quest objectives, and overall storyline progression.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Branching Dialogue:**\n",
        "    *   **Contextual Dialogue Options:** NPCs will react dynamically to player choices made in previous conversations or quests. For example, if a player previously sided with a particular faction, an NPC from an opposing faction might offer different dialogue, express hostility, or refuse to give quests.\n",
        "    *   **Skill/Attribute Checks:** Dialogue options can be gated by player skills (e.g., Persuasion, Intimidation, Lore) or character attributes (e.g., Strength, Intelligence). Passing these checks can unlock new dialogue paths, reveal hidden information, or bypass combat encounters.\n",
        "    *   **Moral/Ethical Choices:** Many conversations will present players with dilemmas that reflect the gray areas of historical conflicts or mythological morality. Choosing to be benevolent, ruthless, cunning, or truthful will lead to different immediate reactions and long-term consequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Multiple Choice Outcomes:**\n",
        "    *   **Objective Resolution:** Quests will often have multiple ways to achieve their objectives. For instance, a quest to retrieve a stolen artifact could be resolved through stealth, negotiation, combat, or even by revealing the theft to a third party, each leading to a different reward or follow-up quest.\n",
        "    *   **Reputation and Faction Standing:** Player choices will directly influence their reputation with various factions and individual NPCs. A positive reputation with one faction might negatively impact standing with another, leading to exclusive questlines or lockouts.\n",
        "    *   **Character Fates:** Key NPCs might have their fates determined by player decisions. Saving a character could lead to them becoming an ally or quest giver, while failing to do so could result in their death, altering the narrative or closing off specific quest paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **World State and Future Quest Availability:**\n",
        "    *   **Environmental Changes:** Major player decisions or questline completions could trigger visible changes in the open world, such as the rebuilding of a ruined village, the establishment of a new trading route, or the destruction of a hostile encampment.\n",
        "    *   **Dynamic Quest Chains:** Completing a quest in a particular way might unlock entirely new quest chains, while ignoring it or resolving it differently could lead to alternative, or even opposing, questlines. For example, if the player chooses to help one lord in a political dispute, they might gain access to quests from that lord but be excluded from those offered by the rival lord.\n",
        "    *   **Evolving Threats and Opportunities:** Player actions can influence the strength and presence of enemy factions, the availability of rare resources, or the stability of various regions, generating new procedural or emergent quests.\n",
        "    *   **Endings and Epilogues:** Major decisions, particularly within the Main Story Quests, will contribute to a more personalized ending or epilogue, reflecting the sum of the player's choices throughout their journey.\n",
        "\n",
        "By implementing these branching logic systems, the game aims to provide a highly replayable and deeply immersive experience, where players feel truly in control of their narrative and its impact on the ancient world."

        "*   **State Synchronization**: Changes in loaded JSON data, dynamic game state (modified by scripts), and visual/physical representations in the engine would be synchronized through event-driven systems (e.g., Unity Events, delegates), observers, or component-based architectures. For example, a script updating a character's health would trigger a UI update and potentially a visual effect on the character model.\n",
